# VLC-Qt Library

VLC-Qt is a free library used to connect [Qt](http://qt.io) and
[libVLC](http://videolan.org) libraries. It contains core classes for main
media playback and also some GUI classes for faster media player development.

VLC-Qt runs on supported versions of Linux, macOS and Windows. It is developed
in cross-platform spirit so it may work on other systems but is not supported.

## VLC-Qt 2.1 Qt/VLC versions
**Since 2.1 release, support for some older Qt and VLC versions will be removed:**
 - Qt only support Qt5+
 - libVLC only support 2.1+

Latest source is also available via Git:
```bash
  git clone git@github.com:winsoft666/vlc-qt.git
```

Master branch is considered stable and working on all supported platforms.
All development is made in branches. You can also find specific releases by
browsing tags.
